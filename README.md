# Blutlust - 2021

An idea for a movement shooter I had, which I eventually scrapped.

When I was in my senior year I was inspired by the classic Id games like Doom and Quake, and being a new developer unaware of the nature of scope creep, I set my sights on undertaking this monumental challenge.

The game was meant to be a movement shooter with loads of abilities and mechanics and amazing visuals and etc.

Coming up with and compiling ideas was really easy, but when It came to asset creation and development of the game itself, progress and motivation was lacking.

Thus I scrapped this idea, maybe sometime in the future I will create a projects based on the universe and ideas I have compiled for this project, but that is for another time.

### Screenshots

In this screenshot you can see the development level (also the only level), it is basically a playground for the player to test their movement abilities or just to simply debug behaiviors under certain conditions.

Here is the POV of the player, I also made some view-models for the players. Making these assets is what ultimately made me realize how much work would be needed to make this game. That paired with my inexperience in development and aweful orginization, meant this project was doomed.
